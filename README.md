# Hi friends, great to see you here! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a kid , just 13, started coding on 29 July 2019. Now, I like to recreate websites on my own just to sharpen my skills!

Hey, get updates here: 
â€¢ Current project(s) - [Rippllino](http://github.com/Swaroop-D/Rippllino)
â€¢ Reach me on swaroopshri2019@gmail.com
â€¢ If you love what I build, please consider contributing on my repositories...
â€¢ Have ever heard about IIFEs? If not search on MDN resource. And a fact about that, inside an IIFE you can add 
`window[yourPleasedName] = function (params) { }`
to call that IIFE using a name!ðŸ˜®

Thanks for joining!ðŸ™‚
